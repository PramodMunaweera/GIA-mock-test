# GIA Practice Test
General Intelligence Assessment (GIA) is a speed test that measures your ability to quickly learn, comprehend and retain information.

The test has 5 sections, each taking 2-3 minutes:

- Perceptual Speed
- Reasoning
- Number Speed and Accuracy
- Spatial Visualisation
- Word Meaning

**Disclaimer ⚠️**

This project was developed independently by me as a practice resource for the GIA test.

This mock test is not affiliated with any official test providers. It is solely a practice tool that includes sample questions for study purposes.
